    "Abstract": "Background.Children with perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (PHIV) may not be protected against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) because of impaired initial vaccine response or waning immunity. Our objectives were to estimate seroimmunity in PHIV-infected and perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children and identify predictors of immunity in the PHIV cohort.",
